# Project

The `Enterprise Scale AI Factory` is a plug and play solution that automates the provisioning, deployment, and management of AI projects on Azure with a template way of working.

It is based on the earlier `Enterpries Scale ML (ESML) AI Factory` open source project: https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml

## Main purpose: 
- It reuses multiple existing Microsoft accelerators/landingzone architecture and best practices such as CAF & WAF, and provides an end-2-end experience including Dev,Test, Prod environments.
- The AI Factory ir `project based`, and provides `multiple templates` besides the infrastructure template, also a `DataLake template, DataOps templates, MLOps templates`, with selectable project types.
- Battle tested, it has been used by customers and partners since 2019 (see LINKS) to accelerate the development and delivery of AI solutions, with common tooling & marrying multiple best practices.

## News!
- Now an AI Factory upate is needed to support Generative AI, as “project type”.
- The current work in progress is to complete the Enterprise Scale GenAI project type, in the AI Factory, and port it to Azure Verified Modules, and continue with the LLMOps template integration.
