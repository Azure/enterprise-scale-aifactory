# Enterprise Scale AI Factory - Template repo

![Header](documentation/images/header.png)

Welcome to the official *Enterprise Scale AIFactory* solution accelerator template. <br>
This is a template repository, bootstrapped with the *Enterprise Scale AIFactory submodule* (the most common way of leveraging the AIFactory template acceleration)

This repo will leverages resources/templates from the [`Enterprise Scale AI Factory submodule`](https://github.>com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml/) including templats for `IaC AI landingzones, DataOps, MLOps, 
GenAIOps`.

The mirror repo based on this repo, will act as your repo with options as: [Github private, internal, public repo](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/administration-governance/essentials/manage-your-repository-visibility-rules-and-settings/), or a [private or public Azure Devops repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/make-project-public?view=azure-devops)

>[!NOTE]
>Since the mirror repo will become your repo (or see BYORepo option), you will not have any failure with tokens/cross-authentication.
>

## The purpose of this repo
This repo, is purposed to bootstrap a repository, that automatically links to the centralized (readonly)submodule `azure-enterprise-scale-ml`, and provides you with templates for YOUR variables, to customize your AI Factory, besides the basic [.env.template](./.env.template) parameters that will end up as Variables in your Github/Azure Devops.

It also provides an automation script to copy templates IaC automation variables and other templates for [DataOps, MLOps, GenAIOps - Read more](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml/).<br>

## Simple mode VS Advanced mode
This repo is the *simple mode* to setup an AIFactory. This contains automation to:
- Automate the [full manual AIFactory setup process seen here](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml/blob/main/documentation/v2/10-19/13-setup-aifactory.md). Estimated time effort for manual setup is 2h, and is reduced to 10min with this repo.
- Set default vaules for all 30 [AIFactory based parameters seen here](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml/blob/main/documentation/v2/10-19/13-parameters-ado.md), saving you estimated time effort of 1h.

The ESML AIFactory with manual seup is said to accelerate setup from 500-1500h down to ~4h setup time.<br>
This repo accelerates even further, below 1h, since leaving only a hand-full of variables to setup in [.env.template](./.env.template)
-> Making it a good choice to quickly setup infrastructure securely for AI-hackathons, workshops, education - scenarios where you are OK if naming convention does not comply 100% with your organizations choices, and you don't need to peer it to your Hub - e.g. where `AIFAcotry standalone mode` is OK.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still go into *advanced mode*, and edit all parameters. You will find them here in the [aifactory/parameters](./aifactory/parameters) folder.
>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>This repo provides a ready-to-run github repo, bootstrapped and connected to the *Enterprise Scale AI Factory Github submodule*.

## Setup options - GITHUB
As a mirror-repo (Github) or "Bring your own repo" (Github or Azure Devops) <br>

After you have copied the  [.env.template](./.env.template) as your [.env](./.env) file, you have the options below.

- A) Bootstrap as a mirror-repo in Github, it becomes a private, internal or public Github repo
    - **When to choose**: If you are allowed to create own repos, and Gihub is your preffered choice.
    - **Automation scripts to run**:  [Bootstrapping a new AIFactory](documentation/bootstrapping.md), or do quickstart: 
    - **Quickstart:**
        - 1) [01a-GH-mirror-repo-from-template-once.sh](./01a-GH-mirror-repo-from-template-once.sh)
        - 2) VS code open up a new Window with your new repo - Rename `.env.template` to `.env` and edit it. 
            - Edit the PARAMETER folder also. 
        - 3) Go to Github.com to your repo, and edit the secret: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` - it should be formatted as follows:
               ```json
                {
                    "clientId": "your-client-id-aka-appId",
                    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret-aka-servicPrincipalSecret",
                    "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
                    "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
                }
                ```
        - 4) Run at least 2 Github Actions workflows at Github.com | or: [04ab-setup-infra-aifactory.sh](./04ab-setup-infra-aifactory.sh)
            - infra-common.yaml
            - infra-project-genai.yaml
- B) Bring your own "empty" repo 
    - **When to choose**: If your organization don't allow you to create repos, or if you preffer Azure Devops.
    - **Automation scripts to run**: See full instructions here:  [Bootstrapping a new AIFactory](documentation/bootstrapping.md)

## Setup options - Azure Devops
As of now, only the `advanced mode` is possible. Using either `.yaml` or `classic`. Bootstrap for this is work in progress.
Please visit the full documentation for here. [Enterprise Scale AI Factory - Setup](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml/blob/main/documentation/v2/20-29/24-end-2-end-setup.md)

> [!NOTE]
>   
> The steps A nd B above will create pipelines in Azure Devops or Github (as GHA workflowws), and the pipelines will setup the AIFactory and AI Factory projects. Before you start you will need configure your [.env](./.env) environment variables. Read more at [bootstrapping.md](./documentation/bootstrapping.md) section.
>

## How to create more projects of different types? 
As explained in previous section you will end up with automation pipelines, in either your own Azure Devops (as Release pipelines) or your own Github repositorys (as Actions/Workflows).

The pipelines, can be executed multiple times, to provision multiple AIFactory projects. 
You only need to change a few parameters in the .env file, and run [02b-GH-create-or-update-github-variables.sh](./02b-GH-create-or-update-github-variables.sh) - values such as below:
```python

PROJECT_NUMBER="001" # <XXX> unique string per aifactory, usually 001,002,003
PROJECT_MEMBERS="qwer123-qwer-wrfe-23fd-asdfqewrt,asdfg-qwer-asdf-23fd-asdf1234" #[GH-Secret] ObjectID in a commas separated list, without space
PROJECT_TYPE="genai-1" # What project type to deploy? [esml,genai-1,genai-2]

```

> [!NOTE]
>**Enterprise security**: Both fully private mode (private link for also the Azure AI Studio) or private link with AI Studio accessible from certain IP. Role-based access control is used, meaning EntraID for all sercice-to-servcice and user-to-service connections. Not using any keys (since global keys have full permission to services, it is not recommended)
